98.	"I know that most men, including those at ease with problems of the greatest complexity, can seldom accept even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to colleagues, which they have proudly taught to others, and which they have woven, thread by thread, into the fabric of their lives." - Tolstoy

From an Evangelist email dated Sat, December 7 1996.

101.	"It seems to me that a person who is at a less aware level of truth is much more insecure about her or his convictions and therefore demands that others agree with her or him. Those who have gone through more levels of truth, however, tend to be more tolerant and open-minded. They can understand the levels they have passed through themselves and envision other levels in the future, even if they do not yet know what they will be. Persons at the highest levels of truth are often lonely because the further one moves along, the more people one leaves behind."  - Women's Reality--An Emerging Female System in a White Male Society by Anne Wilson Schaef.
A quote I saved from a December 20, 1996 Evangelist email.
102.	We did essentially no operating system tuning -- this would have delayed the project and, potentially, increased the risk of putting bugs into working code. Remember, we started working on Rhapsody in late February, and are delivering a robust release in about seven months. The only way you can do this is to be ruthless about setting goals. One of my former managers, Gordon Bell, used to say: "sometimes it's better to have 20 million instructions by Friday than 20 million instructions per second."
This is the response to someone saying that Rhapsody is still slow.  I like the last line.  I first saw the quote around October 1, 1997.
103.	Finally, thanks to those who made sure I caught Guy Kawasaki's interview on NPR's "Talk of the Nation" show yesterday. Guy made one comment that struck me. He was talking about why people clamor to work for Apple. He said that Apple has always been about "making the world a better place", whereas Microsoft is about "controlling the world". He pointed out that both were valid business strategies, but that he had just chosen to work for the company that wanted to make the world a better place.

193. MY FAVORITE LEADERSHIP QUOTE
Someone asked me recently for my favorite leadership quote.  The blog post with this was 3-4 years old, so I thought many of you might enjoy finding it more easily.  It's a passage from John Brown's Body, an early 20th century novel/free verse poem about the US Civil War.  For me, it sums up beautifully the challenges of being a leader, and how planning is everything but plans are nothing.
"If you take a flat map 
And move wooden blocks upon it strategically,
The thing looks well, the blocks behave as they should.
The science of war is moving live men like blocks.
And getting the blocks into place at a fixed moment.
But it takes time to mold your men into blocks
And flat maps turn into country where creeks and gullies
Hamper your wooden squares. They stick in the brush,
They are tired and rest, they straggle after ripe blackberries,
And you cannot lift them up in your hand and move them.
It is all so clear in the maps, so clear in the mind,
But the orders are slow, the men in the blocks are slow
To move, when they start they take too long on the way -
The General loses his stars, and the block-men die
In unstrategic defiance of martial law
Because still used to just being men, not block parts."

"You must retain faith that you will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties.

AND at the same time...

You must confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be."

Cleaning out my todo list I found this one.  I missed adding this one for 3 years!  It refers to the split of Netflix's streaming and DVD business.  Netflix was right that they needed to disrupt their own business and succeed in streaming but could have handled it much better for their customers.  They have recovered well now.

244. "The job of hierarchy is destroy bad bureaucracy." - Chris Fry
Quote seen in the LinkedIn post by Bob Simon entitled "Hierarchy is Good. Hierarchy is Essential. And Less Isn't Always Better" (http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140112221140-15893932-hierarchy-is-good-hierarchy-is-essential-and-less-isn-t-always-better?_mSplash=1).  Chris Fry is now head of Twitter engineering and learned a lot about scaling organization from his time at Salesforce scaling engineering from 40 to 600.  As Bob Simon explains, "When Chris explains why he says that, you realize there is much wisdom in the weirdness. The self-cancelling silliness reflects the ambivalence about hierarchy that so many of us still can't quite shake. There is also a paradox: if you actually wanted to defeat a hierarchy, you would probably have to use the hierarchy itself to do create such anarchy. His core argument, however, is that a well-managed hierarchy is among the most effective weapons for getting rid of the friction, incompetence, and politics that plague bad organizations."
(Added February 26, 2014)
245. "Page has been described as "obsessed with making Google work like a smaller company." In 2001, when Google grew to about 400 people, Page decided that middle managers were creating complexity and friction - symptoms of John Greathouse's "Big Dumb Company Disease." So he got rid of all of them. More than 100 engineers reported to a single overwhelmed executive. Frustration and confusion was rampant. Without those middle managers, it was nearly impossible for people to do their work and for executives to grasp and influence what was happened in the company. Page learned the hard way that a hierarchy can be too flat and that middle managers are often a necessary complexity." - Bob Sutton
A great reminder that even Google struggles with the balance between managers to manage complexity and minimizing organizational complexity. Taken from the LinkedIn post by Bob Simon entitled "Hierarchy is Good. Hierarchy is Essential. And Less Isn't Always Better" (http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140112221140-15893932-hierarchy-is-good-hierarchy-is-essential-and-less-isn-t-always-better?_mSplash=1).  
(Added February 26, 2014)
246. "You have to make sure you never confuse the hierarchy that you need for managing complexity with the respect that people deserve. Because that's where a lot of organizations go off track, confusing respect and hierarchy, and thinking that low on hierarchy means low respect; high on the hierarchy means high respect. So hierarchy is a necessary evil of managing complexity, but it in no way has anything to do with respect that is owed an individual."." - Mark Templeton (CEO of Citrix)
Mark Templeton, CEO of the software firm Citrix, makes a lovely argument about the difference between the need for hierarchy versus how people ought to be treated. Bob Simon quotes something he said in The New York Times in Scaling Up Excellence: "  Taken from the LinkedIn post by Bob Simon entitled "Hierarchy is Good. Hierarchy is Essential.

"Through exhaustive analysis of diaries kept by knowledge workers, we discovered the progress principle: Of all the things that can boost emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a workday, the single most important is making progress in meaningful work." - Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer
Quote from the Harvard Business Review (HBR) article "The Power of Small Wins" (http://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins/ar/1). A great insight for managers and leaders on how best to motivate their teams!

249. "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.  Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it." - Steve Jobs
Quote sent to me by my mom while in the middle of a job change.  Very good reminder that you must love the work you do but that it also may take much of your life to find that work.  As I get older it has gotten more and more difficult to find but that's probably because I've changed too.

250. "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat." - Theodore Roosevelt

Said by many but I finally added this quote after reading Sharon's 2010 post (http://www.sharonkaibel.com/2010/10/first-break-all-rules-12-critical.html). Alternatively seen it as "People leave managers, not companies."  This is something I've really realized recently as I've thought about the managers.  A manager's leadership style is the most important influence on employee retention.
